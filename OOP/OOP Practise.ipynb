    "What are objects?\n",
    "Objects are form of a real world entity that are initialized using the class.\n",
    "How is class and objects implemented?\n",
    "Classes are defined using the class keyword. Objects are initialized using the className() function\n",
    "What are class and instance variables?\n",
    "class variables are variables that are available throughout the class and doesn't need the class to be initialized\n",
    "instance variables are variables that are only created when an object is created as is associated only with that object\n",
    "What are class methods, static methods?\n",
    "Class methods are methods that exists throughtout the class\n",
    "static methods are methods that are associated with the class but doesn't use any of the variables within the classes.\n",
    "What are access modifiers?\n",
    "used for modifying the access of the variables\n",
    "Basically, access modification is non-existent in python but a similar implementation can be done using the double underscore method \"__\""
